Due to the expansion of distribution networks as well as the increase in electricity demand, 
the use of distributed generation sources and capacitor banks is increasing day by day. Determining the installation location and capacity of these tools are two important and effective factors in reducing network power and improving network performance. 
If connected to the grid at the right place, distributed generation power plants and capacitors will have various effects,
including reducing losses, improving voltage and increasing grid reliability. 
In there, in order to determine the optimal location and size of scattered production sources and shunt capacitors in radial distribution systems, 
individually and simultaneously, from the crow search algorithm, which is based on simulating the intelligent behavior of crows in search of food. Used.
To check the effectiveness of the applied method, simulations were performed on case networks of 76 buses and the comparison of the results with the PSO algorithm shows the good performance of CSA in optimization problems and especially the location of DGs and capacitor banks.
